# M5Gothi

M5Gothi brings the powerful Pwnagotchi functions and interface to the M5Cardputer platform, providing both automatic and manual Wi-Fi control through an integrated keyboard interface, so you can finally go touch some grass and hack at the same time. Inspied by the original Pwnagotchi project. It doesn't have AI, but at least its working like it should.

## Features

- Full Pwnagothi functionality adapted for M5Cardputer
- Manual Wi-Fi control via integrated keyboard UI making it first fully UI-controlled pwnagotchi
- Automatic handshake capture using “Pwnagothi Auto Mode”
- **Update firmware directly from GitHub, SD card, or built-in Web UI**
- Advanced personality, for better control over pwnagotchi functions

---
> [!IMPORTANT]
> An SD card is **required** for the firmware to function properly.

### SD Card File Structure

- Configuration file: m5gotchi.conf will be created at first boot and then used to store informations. **Don't mess with it at your own - use device UI to change these values! (Or if you are using lite mode and need to change stuff - be carefull)**
- personality will be saved in file called personality.conf.
- Wpa-sec needed files: uploaded.json, cracked.json. Do not edit those files, and if you're running lite mode and need to view them on pc - use text editor of your choice.
- Captured handshakes will be stored inside a folder called:

  ```
  /handshake
  ```

## Requirements

- [PlatformIO](https://platformio.org/) — for building and flashing the firmware
- Git — for cloning the repository
- All other dependencies are automatically handled by PlatformIO

### Installing PlatformIO

You can install PlatformIO using either:

- **Visual Studio Code extension**
  - Install VS Code
  - Open Extensions → Search for "PlatformIO IDE"
  - Install and reload

- **Command-line (CLI)**
  Follow instructions here: [https://platformio.org/install/cli](https://platformio.org/install/cli)

---

## Build and Flash Instructions

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Devsur11/M5Gotchi/
   cd M5gothi
   ```

2. Build and upload via PlatformIO:

   ```bash
   pio run
   pio run --target upload
   ```

>[!NOTE]
>For esp32s3 dev board: use ONLY lite version binary, connect sd card with these pins or define your own in settings.h

|Esp pin|Sd pin|
|-------|------|
|G12|CS|
|G14|MOSI|
|G40|CLK|
|G39|MISO|

---

## Usage Instructions

>[!IMPORTANT]
>To use any of the functions, pwnagothi mode must be set to MANU, otherwise nothing will work!

- **UI** is fully controlled via the **built-in keyboard**
- Use  `G0` button to turn screen off or change the mode - customize this is settings
- Press `ESC` to open the main menu
- Use **arrow keys** to navigate
- Exit apps using `Fn + ESC`
- On first boot there will be created m5gotchi.conf file - use it to change setting on **lite mode** compilations
- Customize name to your likings via settings
- customize theme to your liking via settings
- Use ENTER to confirm or `y` or `n` when asked to do so
- use `c` to clone wifi when in wifi details menu
- handshakes are stored in `/handshake/` folder with filemanes containing SSID and BSSID of network that was pwned

---

## Lite mode setup:
- Flash lite mode on chosen hardware
- Connect sd card reader with sd card plugged into it into gpio ports mentioned in this file, or defined by you during pre-compilation time.
- Boot the esp32 device for the first time, let it run for like 10-20sec to ensure all required files ware created
- Turn off the device, plug sd card into your pc and open file named m5gotchi.conf with text editor of your liking
- Type your home wifi credentials into savedApSSID and savedAPPass feilds to allow esp32 to connect to interned for updates and wpa-sec sync
- Type your wpa-sec api key into wpa_sec_api_key feild, if you have it (api key, not feild)
- Set lite_mode_wpa_sec_sync_on_startup to true, if you typed your api key and want your handshakes to be synced with wpa-sec servers.
- If your esp32 has a display, and you can see it normally, you can customize hostname and theme to fit your likings
- And finally, set pwnagothiMode to true, to enable its functions
- after first run, a personality file will be created - if you know what you're doing you can customize that file but be warned: **This can inpact ability to work normally!**

## Core dump reporter (MQTT) 🔧

When built with `ENABLE_COREDUMP_LOGGING` the firmware will publish core dump uploads over MQTT to the configured broker. The flow is:

- `device/coredump/meta` — JSON metadata published first. Contains fields:
  - `upload_id` (string)
  - `mac` (string)
  - `board` (numeric board id)
  - `version` (firmware version / build tag)
  - `build_time` (compile timestamp)
  - `reset_reason` (boot reason)
  - `idf` (ESP-IDF version)
  - `chip_model`, `chip_cores`, `chip_rev`
  - `size`, `chunks`, `addr`, `freeHeap`
  - `gps_tx`, `gps_rx` (GPS TX/RX pins configured)
  - `advertise_pwngrid`, `toggle_pwnagothi_with_gpio0`, `cardputer_adv`, `limitFeatures` (boolean flags reported as 0/1)

- `device/coredump/chunk` — messages with a small header JSON (upload_id, seq, len, checksum, total) followed by `\n` and base64-encoded chunk payload.

- `device/coredump/end` — final JSON with `upload_id`, `status`, `sent_chunks`, `checksum` (combined checksum of all bytes).

- `device/coredump/ack/<upload_id>` (or `device/coredump/ack/#`) — the collector should send an acknowledgement JSON with `upload_id`, `status` (`ok` or `complete`), `received_chunks`, and `checksum` when the uploaded file is verified; the device will only erase the core dump after receiving a matching verification ack.

This improves reliability by:

- Sending telemetry (build, IDF, reset reason, chip info) to help debugging
- Using per-chunk and final checksums to detect corruption
- Waiting for a server ACK before erasing the core dump so uploads can be retried if verification fails

An example Python subscriber script that reassembles chunks and publishes the verification ACK is included at `scripts/reassemble_coredump.py` (requires `paho-mqtt`).

A simple Web dashboard is also available to browse and manage reports: `scripts/dashboard.py` reads report metadata in `coredumps/*.json` (created by the reassembler) and provides a UI and API to list reports, download binaries, block/unblock device MACs, and view statistics. Install the dashboard requirements with `pip install -r scripts/requirements.txt` and run it with `python scripts/dashboard.py --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8080`.
